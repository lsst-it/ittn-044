Data Management System-level network specifications (extracted from \href{https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/download/attachments/20284335/LSE-61.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1490879770000&api=v2}{LSE-61 Data Management Subsystem Requirements})

180 days MTBF/year

48 hours MTTR/year

Base to Archive nightly data volume (science images and meta-data): 15TB

Amount of time available to transfer data from Mountain to Base to Archive:

                 Crosstalk-corrected images for Alert Production: 6 seconds to move (between 2.6 - 12.4 Gbytes depending on compression)

                 Raw images: 24 hours

Note, there is also Observatory Control System and other operational data transferred at night, and there is daytime engineering and calibration traffic potentially at the same volume.  Finally, there is periodic data transfer from the Archive to the Base, primarily as a result of annual Data Release Processing.  All the data flows and allocated bandwidths are defined in the following documents.

A grouping of this traffic for purposes of network design, QoS, prioritization etc. is on the \href{https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/DM/LSST+Network+Traffic+Types}{LSST Network Traffic Types}.

A bandwidth allocation by link of this traffic for purposes of network design, QoS, prioritization etc. is on the \href{https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/DM/LSST+Network+Bandwidth+Allocation}{LSST Bandwidth Allocation}.

The LSST Long-Haul Networks are specified in \href{https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/LSE-78/lse78observatoryNetworkDesign_rel5.1_20200825.pdf}{LSE-78 Rubin Observatory Network Design} and \href{https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/LSE-479/lse479observatoryNetworkTechnicalDoc_rel1_20200825.pdf}{LSE-479 Rubin Observatory Networks Technical Document}.

The budgeted cost and schedule of deployment of links and bandwidth, and their utilization is documented in \href{https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/download/attachments/20284335/20170130%20LDM-142%20LSST%20Networks%20BL%20and%20Plan.xls?version=1&modificationDate=1491479508000&api=v2}{LDM-142 Network Sizing Model}

In addition to the top-level documents above, there are documents describing how the LSST Networks are to be tested, verified, and managed:
